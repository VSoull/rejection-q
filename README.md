Want to work as a team?

You gotta lose to win.

Train yourself to:

Get a raise
Sell more
Develop more business
Negotiate better deals
The game has one rule:

You must be rejected by a human being at least once per day.

Ask for things outside your comfort zone, and you'll find yourself winning a lot more.

Win = 1 point. Rejection = 10 points.

How long can you make your rejection streak last?
